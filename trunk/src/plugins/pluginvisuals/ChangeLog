- small bugfixes in skybox and point light entities

boto ( 10/08/2004 )

- adaptations to new framework completed

boto ( 09/09/2004 )

- refactored the pluing for building with static libs


boto ( 03/25/2004 )

- fixed a bug in animated mesh entity related to updating pos/rot during animation


boto ( 03/23/2004 )

- added a base particle system
- added fountain particle system entity


boto ( 03/21/2004 )

- added sprite entity


boto ( 02/23/2004 )

- added keyframe animated mesh entity


boto ( 02/09/2004 )

- added skybox entity


boto ( 02/07/2004 )

- removed gpu prog entity and related link in static mesh entity, as the engine can handle gpu progs in
   a convenient way, now.
 

boto ( 01/07/2004)

- added right handling of gpu programs avoiding multiple compilation and uploading of same gpu program


boto ( 01/06/2004)

- static mesh: added dynamic lighting via point lighting entity


boto ( 01/04/2004)

- creation of cg shader entity for point lighting ( with up to 3 light sources )

 + problem: the vertex program core of neoengine cannot handle multiple instantiation of one program => several intances 
    result in several compilations and gpu uploads.
