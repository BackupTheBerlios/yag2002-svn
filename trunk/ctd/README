The project YAG2002 has two aims in focus: 1. software technology monitoring and evaluation in the area 
of digital content creation and simulation, 2. transfering appropriate technologies to the development 
of a multi-player 3D jump&run / action game "Capture The Diamond" (CTD).

This package contains all C++ sources for YAG2002's framework and game code. The framework is built 
around existing software packages such as 

 - OpenSceneGraph (scene graph management and rendering)
 - Cal3D (character animation)
 - Newton (physics)
 - TinyXML (configurations)
 - ReplicaNet (networking)
 - CEGUI (2D menus and dialogs)
 - and more ...

The framework can be used for developing every kind of 3D games and scientific simulations which need 3D 
content. During the development of CTD the framework is refined and revisited permanently. It offers useful 
services and a convenient way to access all wrapped packages (see above) in order to develop a 3D game-like
application.

Currently the souces are developed with vc7.1 under MS Windows XP. Most packages are multi-platform though
so it would be not very hard to port the whole project to linux or MacOS (Contact me if you are interested in
porting the sources, I could help you).
