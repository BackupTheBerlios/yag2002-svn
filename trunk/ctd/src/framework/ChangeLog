
boto ( 11/13/2005 )

- name space cleanups and filename changes; replaced CTD by yaf3d

boto ( 08/27/2005 )

- began the port to linux

boto ( 07/19/2005 )

- Producer has been replaced by osgSDL.

boto ( 07/01/2005 )

- a console entity with over 30 commands has been implemented supporting automated testing and online diagnosis.

boto ( 04/27/2005 )

- the framework is ready to use, all necessary software packages are integrated, among other things:

 + OpenSceneGraph
 + Newton
 + ReplicaNet
 + CEGUI

- further refinements of framework will be done during the development of CTD

boto ( 04/07/2005 )

- CEGUI is fully integrated
- began work on game settings gui

boto ( 04/04/2005 )

- the new framework basing on openscenegraph is in progress
- also physics simulation using Newton has been integrated
- for gui CEGUI is used
- implementation of game entities in progress

boto ( 02/17/2005 )

- stoped the work on Ogre integration
- began using OpenSceneGraph ( after playing a bit with Nebula2 engine )

boto ( 01/10/2005 )

- shifting to Ogre engine, work in progress

boto ( 12/25/2004 )

- begin of integration of ReplicaNet for networking

boto ( 10/14/2004 )

- todo 

 server client versioning check

boto ( 10/08/2004 )

- small bugfix in send plugin and entity message method

boto ( 10/04/2004 )

- new todos have been implemented

boto ( 10/02/2004 )

- new todos:

1. framework must have methods to hold several sets of plugin managers and rooms ( level sets ) instead of one single room and plugin manager, thus switching between them would be simpler
2. it should be possible to activate / deactivate level sets
3. it should be possible to search for plugin managers and rooms by name
4. the game loop should update only active level sets
5. framework's LoadLevel should create new plugin manager and room and push them into new created level set ( loading a level results in a new level set )
6. it should be possible to destroy level sets ( given their name ), thus incremental level loading would be possible

boto ( 09/27/2004 )

- generated api docs using doxygen
- framework redesign completed

boto ( 09/24/2004 )

- begin redesigning of framework and source directory structure

boto ( 09/10/2004 )

- added a timeout in server for pending client connections, thus avoiding server's connection deadlock

- GLO gui system is now integrated into CTDWidget::Widgets core

- i have still problems with player's smoothing algorithm ( dead-reckoning ) for rotation and positioning

boto ( 09/06/2004 )

- CTDEngineInterface renamed to CTDFramework, we no longer need an engine interface as there are no dynamic libs anymore


boto ( 08/29/2004 )

- the framework has been adapted to reflect the changes due to usage of static engine libs

- the plugins are now also static libs, no dynamic libs can be built anymore due to static engine libs :-(

- rendering phase has been moved to framework ( ctd_application.cpp ). it can not be handled in plugins any longer

boto ( 08/24/2004 ) 

- adaptations of framework and plugins in order to use static engine libs instead of dynamic libs

boto ( 08/04/2004 ) 

- added start level and exit game items to menu
- changed the was how entities get updated. no updates anymore during room's updatin
   as entity ( scene node ) translations can cause removing and adding the node to another
   node which causes a crash in room manger.
   the new entity update function is called 'UpdateEntity' instead of SceneNode overriden 'Update'
- vc7.0 solution changed to vc7.1

boto ( 07/30/2004 ) 

- loading a level can now be done using the menu system

boto ( 07/28/2004 ) 

- added settings manager

boto ( 05/27/2004 ) 

- modified the level loader to allow loading also bsp scenes


boto ( 05/13/2004 ) 

- start implementation of 3d menu
- networking core is further refined and tested, some features ( such as peer-to-peer connection support ) are still missing

boto ( 05/02/2004 )

- finished implementation of server/client negotiation, and remote client object 
   initialization


boto ( 04/14/2004 )

- networking core in framework has been further refined
- extended plugin manager by functions to find entity descriptors
- extended entity descriptor by function GetNetworkingType(); 
  this returns the networking mode: none, network server object or network client object

boto ( 04/07/2004 )

- start adding networking support using RakNet


boto ( 03/08/2004 )

- added multiple data subdirectory support in engine configuration file


boto ( 02/23/2004 )

- further bug-fix for releasing plugins


boto ( 02/16/2004 )

- bug-fix for releasing plugins


boto ( 02/08/2004 )

- added file-based input key configuration into engine interface


boto ( 01/07/2004)

- added releasing of entities and plugins into plugin manager

boto ( 12/09/2003)

- added an engine interface accessible to plugins with most important simulation control functions. 


boto ( 11/05/2003)

-  creation of a core for all initializations and level start-ups

  + level loader which reads a level file is in xml format and allows the description of map file, 
     plugins, entities and their parameterization, etc.
     
  + plugin manager for loading and managing plugins and their entities
