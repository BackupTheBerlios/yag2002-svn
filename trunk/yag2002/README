The project has started in 2002 and 'Yag' stands for 'Yet another game'. The missions in this project are 

1. technology monitoring and evaluation in the area of 3D and multimedia software technologies, 

2. applying appropriate technologies for development of a platform for interactive 3D based multimedia 
   applications, e.g. games.

Currently we develop a framework (Yaf3d) and a Virtual Reality Chat application (VRC) using that framework.
VRC supports an own chat protocol and IRC. During you chat with others you can walk in a 3D world and enjoy 
the environment. Every chat member has an 3D avatar.

Yaf3D is a framework around several software libraries. As you may guess, Yaf stands for 'Yet another framework'.
It is built around existing software packages such as 

 - OpenSceneGraph (scene graph management and rendering)
 - Cal3D (character animation)
 - Newton (physics)
 - TinyXML (configurations)
 - ReplicaNet (networking)
 - CEGUI (2D menus and dialogs)
 - and more ...

The framework can be used for developing every kind of 3D games and scientific simulations which need 3D 
content. During the development of VRC the framework is refined and revisited permanently. It offers useful 
services and a convenient way to access all wrapped packages (see above) in order to develop a 3D game-like
application.

Currently the souces are developed with vc7.1 and vc8.0 on MS Windows XP and gcc on Linux. Most packages are 
multi-platform though so it would be not very hard to port the whole project to MacOS (Contact me if you are 
interested in porting the sources, I could help you).
