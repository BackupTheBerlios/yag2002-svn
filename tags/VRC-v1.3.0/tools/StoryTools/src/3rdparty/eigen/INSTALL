*** HOW TO INSTALL ***********************************************************

This file describes how to install Eigen using the CMake build-system. If
you don't want to (or can't) install CMake, don't worry: as Eigen is a pure
template library, it consists only of header files (*.h) and there's nothing
to compile. So it is enough to copy Eigen's header files to your favorite
include directory, and you're done. Ignore the tests/ subdirectory.

*** INSTALLATION USING CMAKE *************************************************

Like the rest of KDE4, Eigen uses CMake as build-system. You can use CMake to
install Eigen, as follows:

1. Install CMake
  There should exist packages for your favorite operating system, as CMake is
  getting quite widely used.

2. Enter the Eigen source directory (where this INSTALL file is)

3. Run the following command:

        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/

  where /where/to/install/ is the installation prefix. The actual directory to
  which the Eigen include files will be copied is:

        /where/to/install/include/eigen/

  Thus, if you wish to install Eigen to /usr/include/eigen, do:

        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/

4. Run the following command with sufficient privileges:

        make install

  Here, "with sufficient privileges" means that depending on the installation
  directory, this command might require e.g. root privileges. On most
  operating systems, you can do:

        su
        make install

  while Ubuntu/Kubuntu users can do:

        sudo make install

*** HOW TO BUILD TESTS AND EXAMPLES ******************************************

You should first create an out-of-source build directory. In the sequel, we
will call $SOURCEDIR the source directory (where this INSTALL file is) and
$BUILDDIR the build directory.

1. Enter the build directory

  cd $BUILDDIR

2. Run CMake, tell it to build the tests and/or the examples.

  For the tests, do:
    cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON $SOURCEDIR

  For the examples, do:
    cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON $SOURCEDIR

  If it complains that it can't find Qt or qmake, then check that you have
  Qt4 installed, and check that your environment variables are properly
  set up. In particular, Qt4's qmake should be in your PATH.

3. Run make

  make
