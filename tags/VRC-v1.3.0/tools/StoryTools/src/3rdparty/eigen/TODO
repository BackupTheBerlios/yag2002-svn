- find a solution to the problem that doxygen doesn't handle our advanced use
  of C++ templates.
- quaternions (Torsten?)
- optimize matrix inversion if doable without too much more code
- evaluate adding methods for rotation around special axis X,Y,Z
- evaluate adding QR decomposition and eigenvalue computation
- conversion methods/functions/constructors between fixed-size and dynamic-size
  classes.
- add more "see also" \sa doxygen tags (currently done only in VectorBase,
  MatrixBase, MatrixP)
- make sure that people without Qt4 can compile at least the examples that
  don't use Qt4.
- make a pkgconfig file (suggested by jbrefort)
- evaluate throwing exceptions when __EXCEPTIONS is defined
